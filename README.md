# GPPotentialLearner
Code for inferring potential energy landscapes from trajectory information, as shown in iScience and JCP.

# Running the code

The code is organized into a class called PotentialLearner that contains a function which infers potential energy landscapes called learn_potential. To run the code simply apply learn_potential on a trajectory time trace. Optionally specify experimental parameters such as the time step (dt) and temperature (kT) in order to get quantitative results.

An example of how to run the code can be found int example.py

# Contact and documentation

This project is a work in progress. Futher documentation will be added as it is created. For more information about features about the code or how to run it please do not hesitate to contact us at jsbryan4@asu.edu.
